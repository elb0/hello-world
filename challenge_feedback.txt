have hard time understanding the question and don't know how to write-up the results
interpreting R output from model summary
Remembering additive / odds effects
Analysis
The human aspect of statistics which is interpreting and conveying the results. 
Fully interpreting model output.
"understanding when to use which model, and interpreting the results"
interpretation
Interpretation
interpreting r code
Interpreting coefficients 
Really understanding the interpretation of models / tests - which is a good thing
Interpreting data into words.
interpreting random slopes
interpretation of results
"Interpretation of different models, be it glm, gam or glmm "
nothing too challenging 
Do a lot of analysis in a very short time in test 1
Interpreting coefficients and estimates 
Interpretation 
nothing challenging
"with all of the different methods we've learned, I sometimes have a hard time picking out which model to use"
"Interpreting the summary of the GLMint table. Also, I still don't really understand GLMMs and LMMs..."
The math behind most of the work we do. 
Critically analyzing statements 
Interpreting coefficients of GLMs
Interpreting the summaries of the different models.
getting to the point for questions asking for making analysis
interpretation of multiple different effects on one group
R
"the switch from using point estimates to CIs, it took a little while to understand why and how to do it correctly "
Understanding models
"Interpreting R tables (summary, confint)"
I found understanding some of the models to be quite confusing. Especially the log-related functions.
need to write too many things
"describe the complex models (Poisson/Gamma/Binomial) and using code results to analyze hypothesis, e.g. the last question in the test1 Q3c"
